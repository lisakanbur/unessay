                Thesis: As new and innovative technologies emerge, 
                we are seeing the effects on our society. Technology 
                companies are at large, and we boast a new generation 
                of competent technology professionals ready to enter 
                the workforce. Technology is affecting various industries 
                such as finance and sciences, and areas such as machine 
                learning and artificial intelligence have become 
                increasingly popular. With this popularity, we are 
                seeing cutting edge advancements in things like 
                natural language processing and big data, but one 
                field that is being especially impacted is the fashion 
                industry. This industry has already experienced a lot 
                of change, but new technology can have implications on 
                designers, makers and consumers, while driving a whole
                new idea of what the entire fashion system should 
                look like.
